\section*{ABSTRACT}

Component level and system level abstraction of detailed computational geologic 
repository models have resulted in four rapid computational models of hydrologic 
radionuclide transport at varying levels of detail. Those models are described, 
as is their implementation in Cyder, a software library of 
interchangeable radionuclide transport models appropriate for representing 
natural and engineered barrier components of generic geology repository 
concepts. A proof of principle demonstration was also conducted in which these models 
were used to represent the natural and engineered barrier components of a 
repository concept in a reducing, homogenous, generic geology. 
This base case demonstrates integration of the Cyder open source library with the Cyclus 
computational fuel cycle systems analysis platform to facilitate calculation of
repository performance metrics with respect to fuel cycle choices.

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
% Provide a summary of the work conducted:
%      Describe the technical problem clearly
%      support it with a method
% SubSection: Motivation
% Provide a brief description of the importance of the work (what problem it 
%   addresses/solves):
Radionuclide containment behavior of a geologic repository is a strong function 
of spent fuel composition, which varies among alternative fuel cycles. For this 
reason, a generic disposal model capable of integration with a systems analysis 
framework is necessary to illuminate performance distinctions of candidate 
repository geologies, designs, and engineering components in the context of fuel 
cycle options. 

A generic repository model appropriate for systems analysis must emphasize 
modularity and speed while providing modeling options at various levels of 
detail. Sensitivity analyses and abstraction efforts conducted to develop the 
models described in this work sought to capture the dominant physics of detailed 
repository behaviors so that abstracted models can be robustly and flexibly 
implemented in the Cyder disposal environment library without sacrificing the 
simulation speed required by the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator.

\section*{DESCRIPTION OF THE MODELS}

The results of this work consist of four models that are the product of an 
abstraction effort with more detailed tools.  The analytic models modified by 
abstraction and implemented in Cyder include a degradation rate model, a mixed 
cell model, a response function model, and a one-dimensional solution (Leij and 
Van Genuchten \cite{leij_analytical_1991}) to the advection-dispersion equation.

\section*{DISCUSSION OF THE BASE CASE DEMONSTRATION}
\input{base_case/base_case}

\section*{CONCLUDING REMARKS}
The Cyder source code in which these models are implemented as well as 
associated documentation are freely available to interested researchers and 
potential model developers. The application programming interface to this 
software library is intentionally general, facilitating the incorporation of the 
models presented here within external software tools in need of a multicomponent 
repository model.

Furthermore, this work contributes to an expanding ecosystem of computational 
models available for use with the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator. This hydrologic 
nuclide transport library, by virtue of its capability to modularly integrate 
with the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator has laid the foundation for integrated 
disposal option analysis in the context of fuel cycle options.
